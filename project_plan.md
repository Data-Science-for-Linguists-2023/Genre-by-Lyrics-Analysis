#Project Plan:

For this project, I aim to create a machine learning model that can identify
the genre of a song by its lyrics. I want to find out if certain 
lyrics(words/phrases/arrangement of words) are indicative of the genre 
of a song. Ex. adlibs more likely to be rap/hiphop?

To collect my data - I will use Genius API's lyricsgenius package and
work with the "tags" section to sort by genre. Once my request to use the
API is approved, I will start by working with the lyricsgenius package. My 
aim is to have about 50k songs with lyrics and tags to work with. 

Statistical Analysis - As of now I only know how to do Naive Bayes in python.
As we learn about more methods, I hope to find a better fit.
